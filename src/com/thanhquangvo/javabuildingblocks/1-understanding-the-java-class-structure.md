### Fields and Methods
*  An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory (heap memory).
*  Methods = functions in other languages, the full declaration of a method is called a method signature.
*  Variables = field in other languages.
### Comments


```java
 /**
 * Multiple line comment
 * @author thanhquangvo
 */
public class Animal {
    // One line
    void fly() {
        
    }
}
```
### Classes vs. Files
*   Java does not require that the class be public (despite >= 2 classes).
*   When file has one public class which must <span style="color:red">same name with file's name</span> and <span style="color:red">only one class</span> is public in the file.
